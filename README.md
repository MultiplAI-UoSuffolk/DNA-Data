# Clustering DNA Sequencing Data: A Machine Learning Pipeline for Glioma Analysis


**Brief Objective:** A machine-learning biomedical application for clustering DNA. 

## Overview of the project
This project aims to develop a machine-learning pipeline for clustering DNA sequencing data, focusing on glioma, a type of brain tumour. Using data from the National Library of Medicine, the pipeline integrates preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering techniques to analyse high-dimensional sequencing data. The project explores algorithms like k-means and DBSCAN, while employing metrics such as silhouette scores for evaluation. By providing a replicable framework for sequencing data analysis, the project contributes to both data science and biomedical research, with potential applications in understanding gliomaâ€™s genetic profile and advancing genomic studies.
