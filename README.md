# Idea 1: Machine Learning Pipeline for Gene Discoverability and Clustering Analysis of FastQ mRNA Data
Jack's project

**Brief Objective:** Develop a machine learning pipeline to process FastQ mRNA data and perform clustering analysis to identify distinct gene expression patterns.

## Overview of the project
The primary aim of this project is to develop a robust machine learning pipeline for processing FastQ mRNA data and performing clustering analysis. The key objectives include ensuring high-quality data preprocessing, implementing effective normalization and feature selection techniques, and developing a reliable clustering model. By achieving these objectives, the project seeks to identify distinct gene expression patterns, providing valuable insights into the biological significance of the clusters. This will ultimately enhance our understanding of gene expression profiles and their implications in various biological contexts. Additionally, the pipeline will be designed with scalability and reproducibility in mind, ensuring that it can handle large datasets and be easily replicated for future studies.
